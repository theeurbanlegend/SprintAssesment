     <h1 class=" h-12 text-3xl bg-teal-500 font-extrabold text-center font-sans">Personal Info</h1>
        <p class="font-medium font-sans mt-2 mb-2">Im from Kirinyaga in a place called Kagumo. Sound familiar? Well <a class="underline" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kagumo+kirinyaga/@-0.4758774,37.2356443,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x18287f3ea38d89a1:0xb4adfec1db62564d!8m2!3d-0.4758774!4d37.2356443!16s%2Fg%2F11khw4gk3w">Google Maps</a> will clarify that for you! Im the firstborn in a family of two in a humble home.</p>
     <h2 id="education" class="h-12 text-xl bg-teal-500 font-bold text-center mb-4 ">My Education history To date</h2>
       
     <h3 class="w-1/2 bg-teal-400 font-semibold ">Nursery school/Kindergaten</h3>
        <p>I started off with kindergaten at Sumbig Nursery school which is in Ruring'u, Nyeri. It as remote and quiet, surrounded by trees, flowers and basiclly an environment for nursing a tender mind.</p>
     <h3 class="w-1/2 bg-teal-400 font-semibold">Primary school</h3>
        <p>After completing my baby class 1,2 and 3, I enrolled at Nyeri Townview Academy where i studied for <strong>eight good years</strong> but as they say <em>The roots of education are bitter but the fuits are sweet</em> though for me it was my first harvest. I passed my <abbr title="Kenya Certificate of Primary Education">K.C.P.E</abbr> with flying colors.&#127752;;</p>
     <h3 class="w-1/2 bg-teal-400 font-semibold">High school</h3>
        <p>I could write a separate blog about my experiences in high school cause it brings so much memories, flooding my brain.During this mini-era of my life, I schooled at Kagumo High School(which is a five star school by the way). Though it was for a period of four years, I still feel that I had ived there my entire life. Perhaps I had been most sentinent at the time during my schooling years. Though high school had a lot to teach me, I am still glad I got out in one piece.
     </p>
     <h3 class="w-1/2 bg-teal-400 font-semibold">Future Education boosts</h3>
        <p>Well as i write this, I  probably havent completed the <abbr title="Kenya Universities and Colleges Placement Service">KUCCPS</abbr> form for university placement, though three universities pop up in my mind when thinking about this:</p>
     <ul class=" ml-5 list-disc">
        <li>Technical University Of Kenya</li>
        <li>Kenyatta University</li>
        <li>Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>Though if anybody inquired of me to select universities abroad I would suggest these from my wishlist;</p>
     <dl>
        <dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;University Of Oxford</dt>
            <dd class="ml-6">Its a renown international university located in the United Kingdom.I wish to see the UK.</dd>
        <dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;University Of Cambridge.</dt>
            <dd class="ml-6">Its also located in the United Kingdom and is more or less located in the same region as Oxford.</dd>

        <dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;The University Of Edinburgh</dt>
            <dd class="ml-6">Its in the United kingdom as well. Its insignia is very stylish and is much older than the first two.</dd>
     </dl>
    <div class="flow-root">
     <h2 id="hobbies" class="h-12 bg-teal-500 font-bold text-center mb-4">Hobbies</h2>
        <img src="/images/Hobbies.jpg" alt="Hobbies multifont" loading=lazy class="w-1/2 opacity-90 float-left mb-2">
        <p>Typically, I make the most of what is around me to enjoy myself. However, there are some things that elevate my mood in particular.</p>
    </div>

     <div class="flow-root">
     <h3 class="w-full bg-teal-300 font-semibold mb-5">Sports</h3>
       
        <p>I generally like sports, they help me burn calories and maintain stamina. However, the sport i adore most is badminton.
            Back at School, I was so good I became the captain of this club.
        </p>
    </div>
     <h3 class="w-full bg-teal-300 font-semibold">Novels</h3>
        
        <p>I also love reading novels in my spare time. The ones that mostly captivate me are sci-fi novels. They just bring out magic in reading. Some of my favourite books and writers are:</p>
     <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
        <li>The Stormlight Archive sequel by Brandson Sanderson</li>
        <li>The Wheel of Time series which is a collaboration of writers eg Sanderson</li>
        <li>Skyward by Brandson Sanderson</li>
        <li>Percy and the Greek Gods by Rick Riordan</li>
        <li>Mistborn and the  Wax and Wayne series by Brandson Sanderson</li>
    </ul>
     <h3 id="music" class="w-full bg-teal-300 font-semibold " >Music</h3>
        <p>My favourite types of music are <abbr title="Electronic Dance Music">EDM</abbr> music and Afrobeats. EDM is mostly by Alan Walker and licensed DJ's to copyright of his music. For afrobeats, I love Omah Lay's songs.</p>
     <h3 id="coding" class="w-full bg-teal-400 font-semibold ">Coding</h3>
        <p>Basically, I love making things that are useful in everyday life and coding gives me that power.The current era is a technological age.However, I couldnt pool enough resources to facilitate my coding. DirectEd Foundation gave me a stepping stone to achieve my coding potential.They gave me learning resources as well as tutor support on how to code, and thats why i wish to learn programming with DirectEd.
            Through them, Ive been able to learn HTML and CSS as well as Java Script, through their guidance, I've attempted the following projects:
